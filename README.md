### Step 1. Create an App
1. Log in to the [Chat Console](https://console.trtc.io/). If you already have an app, record its SDKAppID.
2. On the **Application List** page, click **Create Application**.
3. In the **Create Application** dialog box, enter the app information and click **Confirm**.
> After the app is created, an app ID (SDKAppID) will be automatically generated, which should be noted down.

### Step 2: Obtain Key Information

1. Click **Application Configuration** in the row of the target app to enter the app details page.
2. Click **View Key** and copy and save the key information.
> Please store the key information properly to prevent leakage.

### Step 3: Download and Configure the Demo Source Code

1. Clone this TUIKit_Flutter project.
2. Open the project and locate `chat/demo/lib/login_page.dart`.
3. Set relevant parameters in the `login_page.dart` file:

- SDKAPPID: set it to the SDKAppID obtained in [Step 1](#step1).
- SECRETKEY: enter the key obtained in [Step 2](#step2).

> In this document, the method to obtain UserSig is to configure a SECRETKEY in the client code. In this method, the SECRETKEY is vulnerable to decompilation and reverse engineering. Once your SECRETKEY is leaked, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is only suitable for locally running a demo project and feature debugging**.
> The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your app can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, please see [How do I calculate UserSig on the server?](https://trtc.io/document/34385?product=chat&menulabel=serverapis).

### Step 4: Compile and Run the Demo
1. Open `TUIKit_Flutter/chat/demo` with Android Studio.
2. Run `flutter pub get` to obtain plugin dependencies..
3. Connect an Android/iPhone device or start an emulator, and run the demo.

When you run it successfully, you'll see this UI:
